## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(rankprob)

fit <- nnet::multinom(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data = data,
                      Hess = TRUE)

fit <- convert_rankprob(fit)

p <- predict(fit, rankings = list(c("A", "B", "C", "D"),
                                  c("B", "A", "D", "C")))

head(p)

marginaleffects::avg_slopes(fit, type = "rank_probs")
```
